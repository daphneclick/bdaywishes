# Birthday Wishes for Mike Sakellarides

I NEED YOUR VIDEOS

Hello! It’s me, Daphne Sakellarides (Mike’s daughter). Don’t tell my dad, but I need your help in celebrating my dad’s birthday (May 23rd)!
Five years ago, my dad was diagnosed with an advanced stage of cancer, and he just had a clean MRI result. We want to celebrate this important milestone!

My dad has met so many wonderful people (that’s you), and I’m assembling a video featuring all your friendly faces from over the years.

What I need from you— A video from you wishing my dad a happy birthday. Be as brief or as long-winded as you like! If you have a fun story or wonderful memory to share of something you experienced with Mike, that would make it even more special. Whatever you like. I am a professional video editor and will edit you all together for pacing, etc. (Don’t worry, I’ll make you look good.)

So record a video on your smartphone and send it to me by May 22nd, 3 PM Eastern/ 6 PM Pacific. You can send it via one of the following ways:

1. Upload it directly here to my DropBox:
https://www.dropbox.com/request/ISkFFhI7O28NcOPUa0yx

2. Message me a link to your video on your DropBox, Google Drive, iCloud Drive, or OneDrive account.
DO NOT POST VIDEO TO MY FATHER’S FACEBOOK PAGE

If you think of someone who should be invited to record a video, please send me their name!
